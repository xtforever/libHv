KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS

1) Postscript woes

  The biggest known problem in Hv is the fragile
  nature of the postscript code. We patch things
  as reported, but it is fair to say the complete
  satisfaction with a printout is probably the
  exception rather than the rule. However, "good
  enough" results are obtained most of the time.


  ANY and ALL help in making the ps code more robust
  would be greatly appreciated and acknowledged.
  In lieu of user support, we'll trundle along as best
  as we can.


CHANGES

********* version 1.0042 ****************

A lot of uninteresting bug fixes from 1.0032
through the unreleased versions and up to
the released version 1.0042. A big change is
to the directory structure, which is now more
amenable to multiplatform development.

******** version 1.0032 ******************

minor bug fixes, including the omission of
Hv_DONOTHINGONRESIZE for the drawing tools
in the hvplot demo (reported by Ed Kearns)

******** version 1.0031 *******************

1) There is a new environment variable HV_CC
   assumed in the Makefile. This is to make it
   easier to switch compilers. The canonical
   recommendation is to use gcc whenever it
   is available. The Makefiles and the example
   installation scripts are aware of this new
   variable.

2) Main window geometry

The main window can now be given absolute geometry,
rather than the default (wherein it is calculated
as a certain percentage of the display). This is
done via Hv_LEFT, Hv_TOP, Hv_WIDTH and Hv_HEIGHT
attributes in Hv_VaInitialize. If the attributes
are not set, the usual default sizing is performed.

3) Main window background color

The main window background color can now be set
via an attribute (Hv_MAINWINDOWCOLOR) to Hv_VaInitialize.
The default will remain the familiar blue tone.

NOTE:

This attribute is a little tricky, in that it should
be a pointer to one of the Hv colors, NOT the color
itself. For example, to make the background red,
pass the attribute pair

    Hv_MAINWINDOWCOLOR,   &Hv_red

to Hv_VaInitialize.

The reason is that at this point in the process,
the colors have not been defined, so that the
value of Hv_red is garbage. So we latch on to its
address, and later, when it is safe, set the
main window color to the contents.

4) Motionless Feedback

Some users wanted the feedback to update even if
the mouse wasn't moved. This is because the content
of the hotrect was changing dynamically and they
didn't want to kick start the feedback by moving
the mouse.

Motionless feedback is implemented through a timer
on a view by view basis. It is activated via
two new attributes which can be used at view
creation (i.e. through Hv_VaCreateView):

  attibute                 type       default
============================================
Hv_MOTIONLESSFB            Boolean     False 
Hv_MOTIONLESSFBINTERVAL    int         1000

Hv_MOTIONLESSFBINTERVAL is in milliseconds, it is
the time interval between automatic calls to the
view's regular feedback routine, using the location
of the mouse at the time the timer expired.

5) MUCH snazzier drawing tools.The old drawing tools
   are still there, and are still created via
   Hv_StandardTools. The new tools, which make
   use of the new Hv native view menus, (available
   since version 1.0030) are created via a new
   routine: Hv_AddDrawingTools, which has
   the same arguments, so that a switch should
   be painless. For example:

       Hv_AddDrawingTools(View,
	 	     View->hotrect->right+10,
		     View->hotrect->top-3,
		     Hv_HORIZONTAL,
		     Hv_SHIFTXONRESIZE,
		     Hv_lightSeaGreen,
		     True,
		     &BaseLeft,
		     &BaseRight);

6) Font selection on HotRect text items, such as those
   created by the drawing tools, is greatly improved.
   Font selection is no done via three option menus,
   one each for the font family, size, and style. This
   is the way it should always have been done, but we
   had trouble (until recently) with Motif's menu
   history mechanism.
   
7) hvplot has been updated to version 1.0014

8) the demo "simple" has been updated to display most
   of these changes.
